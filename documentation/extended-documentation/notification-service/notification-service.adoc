Notification Service
--------------------

Payara Server version 4.1.1.163 introduced a general Notification
service in order to log events which come from other services, such as
the
link:/documentation/extended-documentation/health-check-service/health-check-service.adoc[Health
Check service] or the
link:/documentation/extended-documentation/request-tracing-service/request-tracing-service.adoc[Request
Tracing service]

The Notification service provides the ability to disseminate
notification events through various channels that are being created by
other services, such as the Request Tracing and Health Check services.
The Notification service is provided with a number of configurable
_notifiers_, the default being a log notification mechanism which can be
seen in this `domain.xml` snippet:

---------------------------------------------------
<notification-service-configuration enabled="true">
    <log-notifier-configuration enabled="true" />
</notification-service-configuration>
---------------------------------------------------

The main configuration tag `notification-service-configuration` has only
one attribute, named `enabled`, which can be set to either `true` or
`false`. This provides the ability to globally enable or disable all
notifications to all configured notifiers.

The `<log-notifier-configuration>` tag registers a log notifier to the
pub-sub model of the notification service where it subscribes to each
log notification event that would get published by another service.

The Notification service can be configured through the admin console:
