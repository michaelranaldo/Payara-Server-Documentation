JMX Monitoring Service
----------------------

_Payara Server 4.1.1.163 onwards_

With the release of Payara Server 163, Payara offers a JMX Monitoring
Service. Once configured, Payara Server will monitor and log the values
of attributes that have been listed for monitoring. The metrics are
logged together in a single log message as a series of key-value pairs
prefixed by the string `PAYARA-MONITORING:`.

Payara uses the AMX API for working with JMX MBeans. AMX is not fully
exposed by default and as such needs to be loaded to access most JMX
MBean objects. The JMX Monitoring Service can be used without AMX but
there is a limit to what can be monitored without it.
