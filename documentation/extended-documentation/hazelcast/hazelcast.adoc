= Hazelcast

This page covers how to use the Hazelcast functionality in Payara {{ book.currentVersion }}.

Hazelcast is an In-Memory Data Grid, providing Web and EJB session
persistence, and implementing JSR107 (JCache) in Payara Server.

== Enabling Hazelcast

In the default domain configuration of Payara, Hazelcast is not enabled.
It can be enabled either through the Admin Console, or by using a command line
_asadmin_ command.

=== Enabling Hazelcast through the Admin Console

From the Admin Console home:

* Select the instance's configuration from the page tree:

image::/images/hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-select-instance-config.png[Payara Server 4.1.2.172 Page Tree]

* Click the "Hazelcast" button to view the "Hazelcast
Configuration" page:

image::/images/hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-select-hazelcast.png[Payara Server 4.1.2.172 Hazelcast Selection]

* Check "Enabled" (and optionally "Dynamic" to apply
the configuration without a restart) and save.

image::/images/hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-enable-hazelcast.png[Payara Server 4.1.2.172 Enabling Hazelcast]

=== Enabling Hazelcast using Asadmin

The `set-hazelcast-configuration` asadmin command requires you to
specify whether or not Hazelcast is enabled each time you run it. This
command is also used to configure Hazelcast, which is covered
link:configuring-hazelcast-using-asadmin[below]. The command requires the
Admin Server to be running, and will expect it to be listening on port 4848
unless specified differently with the asadmin utility `--port` option.

`asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=true`

If no target is specified, the command will enable Hazelcast on the
domain configuration _(server-config)_. To enable Hazelcast on another
instance or cluster, use the `--target` option like so:

`asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=true --target=${Target}`

The `dynamic` option of the asadmin command defaults to true, so to
enable Hazelcast and require a restart of the target instance/cluster, use
`--dynamic=false`:

`asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=true --dynamic=false`

[[configuring-hazelcast]]
== Configuring Hazelcast

Payara Server supports configuring Hazelcast through the Admin Console and
asadmin commands. The Hazelcast configuration file can also be directly edited,
but will not be covered in  depth in this section.

Using a Hazelcast configuration file will cause the settings set via the Admin
Console and _asadmin_ commands to be ignored. Any parameters not specified in
the configuration file reverting to the Hazelcast defaults, even if they are
specified in the Admin Console or _domain.xml_ (Note - the link::https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-default.xml[Hazelcast defaults]
are not necessarily the same as the Payara Hazelcast defaults).

=== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File with the Admin Console

To set the Hazelcast configuration from a Hazelcast Configuration file:

* Select the instance's configuration from
the page tree and click the "Hazelcast" button to view the "Hazelcast
Configuration" page:

image::/images/hazelcast/hazelcast-select-hazelcast.png[Payara Server 4.1.2.172 Hazelcast Selection]

* On the Hazelcast Configuration page, add the path to your Hazelcast
Configuration file and click "Save". This path is relative to your domain
configuration directory.

image::/images/hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-set-configuration-file.png[Payara Server 4.1.2.172 Hazelcast Set Configuration File]

=== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File using asadmin

The `set-hazelcast-configuration` command can be used to set the configuration
file:

`asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --hazelcastconfigurationfile /path/to/file --enabled=true`

As with the admin console, this path is relative to your domain configuration
directory.

[[configuring-hazelcast-with-the-admin-console]]
=== Configuring Hazelcast with the Admin Console

Navigate to the _Hazelcast Configuration_ page of your instances configuration.

image::/images/hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-hazelcast-options.png[Payara 4.1.2.172 Hazelcast Options]

The following configuration options are available here:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====
|Property |Description
|Enabled |Whether or not Hazelcast is enabled.

|Dynamic |Determines if the Hazelcast member embedded in Payara will be
restarted to apply any changes made

|Override Configuration File |Specifies the Hazelcast configuration file
to use. The path specified is relative to the domain config directory.

If you are using a custom GlassFish server configuration for a cluster
or standalone instance (e.g. _cluster-config_), then the Hazelcast
configuration file should be placed in the directory with the same name
(e.g. <domain-root>/config/cluster-config). This will ensure it is
replicated to the node during startup.

Using this option to point to a valid Hazelcast configuration file will cause
all other options set to be ignored. Any options unset within the Hazelcast
configuration file will be set to the Hazelcast defaults.

|Cluster Group Name | Specifies the Hazelcast group name, to be optionally used
 to help divide clusters into logical, segregated groups (i.e. _dev-group_,
   _prod-group_).

|Cluster Group Password |Specifies the password used to access the Hazelcast
group.

|Start Port | The port to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy, the port
specified will be incremented until a valid port is found.

|Multicast Port |The multicast port for communications in the Hazelcast
cluster.

|Multicast Group |The multicast group for communications in the
Hazelcast cluster.

|JNDI Name |The JNDI name to bind the Hazelcast instance to.

|License Key |Enables
link::https://hazelcast.com/products/enterprise/[Hazelcast Enterprise]
features.

|Lite Cluster Member|If set to true, cluster members with this configuration
will be Hazelcast "lite" nodes, meaning they will not store any cache data
locally and rely on other cluster members to store data.

|Host Aware Partitioning |Whether or not to enable
link::http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#grouping-types[host-aware partitioning]
 for the cluster.
Host aware partitioning *must be* enabled
on all members of the cluster (including Payara Micro instances) for
this feature to work correctly.
|====

Enter your required values, and click _Save_. Restarting the domain or
instance/cluster is not necessary for any changes made to take effect, provided
that "Dynamic" remains set to "_true_"

[[configuring-hazelcast-using-asadmin]]
=== Configuring Hazelcast using Asadmin

As noted in the previous section, the `set-hazelcast-configuration`
asadmin command is used to both enable/disable Hazelcast, and to
configure it. You can pass the ``--help` option to the command to see
usage instructions and available arguments in your terminal, both of which
are listed below:

[cols=(,,,,),options="header"]

To view the current cluster members from the terminal, run one of the _asadmin_
commands:

----
asadmin> list-hazelcast-members
{ server-/127.0.0.1:5900-this }
----

----

[[using-hazelcast-in-your-applications]]
== Using Hazelcast in your Applications

The following sections will detail how to use the Hazelcast embedded in
Payara within your code.

[[accessing-the-jndi-registered-hazelcast-instance]]
=== Accessing the JNDI registered Hazelcast instance

By default, the JNDI name of the hazelcast instance is
_payara/Hazelcast_, though this can be altered using the
`set-hazelcast-configuration` command.

You will need to import the following packages into your Java class:

[code,Java]
----
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import javax.naming.Context;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;
----

To import the Hazelcast package, you will need to set the Payara
Hazelcast package as a dependency in the project _pom.xml_ file (for
Maven projects), or have the Hazelcast JAR set as a project
dependency (if using a non-Maven based project). To add the Payara
Hazelcast package as a dependency in a pom, enter the following in the
dependencies section of your pom:

[code,Maven_POM]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>fish.payara.api</groupId>
  <artifactId>payara-api</artifactId>
  <version>{{ book.currentVersion }}</version>
</dependency>
----


The Hazelcast JAR (for non-Maven projects), can either be downloaded
from the link::http://hazelcast.org/download/[Hazelcast website], or you can
make use of the JAR packaged with Payara. The JAR packaged with Payara
can be found at _<Payara Installation Directory>/glassfish/modules/hazelcast.jar_.

The following will initialise a `HazelcastInstance` variable with the
instance embedded in Payara:

[code,Java]
----
Context ctx = new InitialContext();
HazelcastInstance instance = (HazelcastInstance) ctx.lookup("payara/Hazelcast");
----

You will have to wrap this in a try-catch clause, or throw the
_Naming Exception_ that this could generate.

[[using-hazelcast-for-the-web-and-ejb-container-persistence]]
