Management of Hazelcast Cluster Members
---------------------------------------

The Hazelcast page in the Admin console contains the _Cluster members
_tab, which provides the overview of the current members attached to the
Hazelcast cluster. For the domain, you can display the page when you
click on _Hazelcast_ tab in the _Domain_ section.

The page displays the table with all connected members, including Payara
Server DAS, Payara Server instances and Payara Micro instances. Below
are separate tables for Payara Server instances and Payara Micro
instances.
