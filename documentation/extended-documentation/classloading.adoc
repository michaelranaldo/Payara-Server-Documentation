[[overview]]
1. Overview
-----------

This page covers how to use the Enhanced Class and Library Loading functionality in Payara 4.1.1.162.

[[documentation-conventions]]
2. Documentation Conventions
----------------------------

_$\{Product-Root}_ - This is the root of the Payara server directory, referring to where you have Payara installed. +
_$\{Domain}_ - This refers to the name of your Payara domain. +
_$\{Target}_ - This refers to the name of an instance or cluster. +
`...` - Denotes a skipping of unrelated code that would be present in the actual file or program. +
_$\{Cluster-Config}_ - This refers to the name of a cluster configuration.

[[default-class-and-library-loading]]
3. Default Class and Library Loading
------------------------------------

Payara server comes included with many Java libraries and packages, for example Google Guava, Jackson, Logback and others. +
By default, due to the way Java Class Loading works, if a class is found in one of Payara-included libraries, it will be the one +
used in your application, even if you include a different version of the same library in your application package.

[[possible-issues-with-default-behavior]]
3.1 Possible issues with default behavior
-----------------------------------------

In some cases, application developer will want to include a different version of the libraries that are already included in Payara. +
A common case is a later version of Guava or Jackson. Another case is to include older versions of these packages for compatibility. +
Unfortunately, due to the default class loading behavior, this will not be possible, and Payara-included libraries will take precedence.

[[solutions-to-the-class-loading-issue]]
4 Solutions to the Class Loading issue
--------------------------------------

[[globally-override-payara-included-libraries]]
4.1 Globally override Payara-included libraries
-----------------------------------------------

You can set the system property `fish.payara.classloading.delegate` to `false`. +
This way, any library that is included by the application developer will override the one that's included in Payara. +
Class Loading is accomplished in the following order:

* Libraries From WAR files - `WEB-INF/lib` - Optional, controlled by the `<class-loader>` directive in `web.xml` +
* Libraries From EAR files - usually `/lib` +
* Libraries from the Domain - _$\{Domain}_/lib +
* And finally, libraries from Payara itself - _$\{Product-Root}_/modules

This is a Payara-specific feature

[[war-files]]
4.2 WAR Files
-------------

For WAR files, you can include `<class-loader delegate="false"/>` in your `WEB-INF/glassfish-web.xml`. +
With this option, your `WEB-INF/lib/xxx.jar` libraries will take precedence over Payara-included libraries. +
This option is also provided by GlassFish Server 4 Open Source Edition.

[[ear-files]]
4.3 EAR Files
-------------

For EAR files, you can include `<classloading-delegate>false</classloading-delegate>` in your `META-INF/glassfish-application.xml` file. +
With this option, your EAR-included libraries will override Payara-included libraries.

[[payara-domain]]
4.4 Payara domain
-----------------

The only way to enable libraries in the _$\{Domain}_/lib to override Payara-included libraries ( _$\{Product-Root}_/modules ) +
is to set the system property `fish.payara.classloading.delegate` to `false` as described above.

[[conclusion-and-recommendations]]
5. Conclusion and Recommendations
---------------------------------

We recommend that you set the system property `fish.payara.classloading.delegate` to `false` as this behavior is the desired behavior +
for most cases. The reason this is not the default out-of-the-box is because Payara wants to keep drop-in replacement compatibility +
with GlassFish.
