Application Deployment
----------------------

You can deploy the applications to Payara Server in the same way as to
GlassFish Server 4.1 Open Source Edition. Payara Server does not modify
this process, it only adds some improvements, so it is safe to refer to
the GlassFish Server Application Deployment guide in
https://glassfish.java.net/documentation.html[GlassFish Server 4 Open
Source Edition documentation]

This section describes additional improvements added by Payara Server.
