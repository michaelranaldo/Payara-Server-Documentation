= Application Deployment

You can deploy the applications to Payara Server in the same way as to
_GlassFish Server 4.1 Open Source Edition_. Payara Server does not modify
this process; **BUT** adds some improvements, so it is safe to refer to
the GlassFish Server Application Deployment guide in
https://glassfish.java.net/documentation.html[GlassFish Server 4 Open
Source Edition documentation].

This section describes these additional improvements.
