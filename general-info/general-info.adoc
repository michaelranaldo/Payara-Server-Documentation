This page provides some general information about the Payara Project.

[[release-strategy]]
== Release Strategy

Payara has a release every quarter. Each release incorporates fixes and
enhancements from the Payara team, GlassFish upstream, and the community.

[[naming-strategy]]
== Naming Strategy

The Payara Server naming strategy works off of the pre-existing GlassFish
naming strategy: Append the year and quarter as the final dot version of
the release. For example, for the Payara Server's release built on GlassFish
4.1, released in quarter 3 of 2015, the version number would be payara-4.1.153.

In the case of updates, we will simply attach an additional point number
to the end of the version number described above. For example, if a
patch is released for Payara 4.1.152, the version number would be
4.1.152.1. This will be in addition to any extra point releases that
Oracle do for GlassFish, so it's possible for a version number to be
something like 4.1.1.152.1!

Releases made to date include:

[[work-strategy]]
== Work Strategy

_Since Payara Server 4.1.152_

We currently have a set strategy to balance receiving the latest Glassfish
upstream changes with a need to avoiding making late changes to a release.

[[change-freeze]]
=== Change Freeze

Two to three weeks before a release, we will implement a change freeze.
This means that no new features or changes will go into the coming release
of Payara Server.

The remaining two to three weeks will be used for finding any bugs brought
on by changes and fixes implemented for the coming release. If any bugs are
found, these will be corrected before the release; if we can't fix it before
the release date, we will simply revert the change that caused the bug
(pending a review).

[[glassfish-upstream-cherry-pick]]
=== GlassFish Upstream Cherry-Pick

We aim to do three cherry picks from the GlassFish upstream for each
release: just after a release; at the beginning of the penultimate month
of the release; and again at the beginning of the final month of the
release (before the change freeze). + This to allow us time to find and
fix any errors that may be brought in from the GlassFish upstream.

If a bug fix is committed to the GlassFish upstream during our change freeze, we will consider pulling in that solitary commit before the release.

[[github]]
== GitHub

The Payara project is hosted on GitHub, allowing us to make use of the
various tools GitHub has integrated for managing projects.

GitHub also makes allowing the community access to view and edit the source
code very easy and public.

[[how-to-contribute]]
=== How to Contribute

We make use of  https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/[the Fork and Pull model].
This means that if you want to make any changes, you'll need to fork the
Payara project and make your changes in your own repository. You will then
need to create a pull request back into the Payara project's master branch
to merge your changes into the main project.

Before we merge your pull request though, you must read and sign the
Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending it to us at
the address specified on the document, or as an email attachment to
info@payara.fish.

Once we've received the CLA and checked it for any mistakes, we'll allow
any pull requests you've made to start being merged.

In most cases, pull requests will not be merged immediately. This is to
allow the Payara team, and other members of the community, to review and
deliberate over any of the changes made; we will typically wait 2-3 days
before merging any pull requests.

[[issue-tracking]]
=== Issue Tracking

We make use of GitHub's integrated https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues[issue tracker]
to allow the community to create enhancement and bug fix requests.
The only requirements to create a bug fix or enhancement request is a
GitHub account, and a reproducible bug or idea for an enhancement; you do
not need to sign the _CLA_ to create an enhancement or bug fix request.
We also provide an https://github.com/payara/Payara/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.adoc[Issue Template]
that can help you describe bug reports or enhancement requests in an
easier manner.

Someone on the Payara team, or someone from the community, will then
investigate and converse with you about the enhancement request or bug report.

We also attach labels and milestones to issues to help both us, and the
community, manage the workflow of these issues.

[[documentation]]
== Documentation

We make use of GitBook to store and host our technical documentation about
Payara, as well as general information (such as this document) about the
Payara project.

For technical documentation, we only store documentation that we have
written, which typically pertains to new or modified features and commands
made by us or the community; we do not host GlassFish documentation,
nor will we rewrite it for unmodified modules.
